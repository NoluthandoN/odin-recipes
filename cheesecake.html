        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <p><b>Base:</b></p>
            <li>1 cup plus 2 tablespoon (160g) all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/3 cup plus 1 tablespoon (85g) packed light brown sugar</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>6 tablespoon (84g) unsalted butter, melted</li>
            <p><b>Filling:</b></p>
            <li>1/2 cup (120ml) heavy whipping cream or milk</li>
            <li>1 vanilla bean or 1 1/2 vanilla extract</li>
            <li>3 pkgs (750g) cream cheese softened</li>
            <li>1 cup (200g) granulated sugar</li>
            <li>3 large eggs at room temperature</li>
            <li>1/4 cup (60ml) full fat sour cream</li>
            <p><b>Topping</b></p>
            <li>1/2 cup (120ml)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon (15ml) granulated sugar</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 300Â°F. Line the base of an 8-inch round springform pan with a round of
parchment paper.</li>
             <li><b>Make the crust.</b> Combine flour, brown sugar and salt in a medium bowl so there are no
lumps of brown sugar. Stir in melted butter and use your fingertips to combine all ingredients
so it forms damp crumbs. Turn the crumbly mixture out into prepared pan and press it down
in an even layer, pushing it about 1-inch up the sides to form an edge. Run the back of a
spoon across the surface to smooth it out. Bake for 15-17 minutes until slightly puffed and
lightly golden. Transfer to a wire rack</li>
            <li><b>Make the filling.</b> First infuse the cream or milk. Pour cream or milk into a small saucepan.
Split the vanilla bean in half lengthwise then run a paring knife along the inside of it to scrape
out all of the little black seeds. Add the seeds to the cream or milk and then place the scraped
vanilla pod in there too (it also has lots of flavor!) Cover the saucepan and place it over
medium-low heat until it just comes to a simmer. Turn off the heat and let it stand, covered,
for 10 minutes to infuse.</li>
            <li>Add cream cheese to a large bowl and beat using a hand mixer on medium speed until
smooth. You can also use a stand mixer with the paddle attachment, or you can use a food
processor. Add sugar and beat until silky and glossy. Beat in eggs one at a time, and mix well
between each addition so each egg is evenly incorporated before adding the next one. Mix in
sour cream until evenly blended. Gradually pour in the vanilla-infused cream or milk while
mixing until evenly combined. If you're not using the vanilla bean, then this is where you can
mix in the vanilla extract.</li>
            <li>Pour the filling slowly over the pre-baked crust and smooth out the surface. Gently tap the
pan on the counter to release any air bubbles, and then pop the bubbles that come to the
surface. Bake for 45 minutes until set around the edges and slightly wobbly in the center. Turn
off the oven and leave it in (with the door still closed) for another 15 minutes. This gentle
cooking produces the silkiest texture. Open the oven door and let it cool in the oven for 10
minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely. The gentle cooling will help to
prevent cracking. Let the cheesecake cool for at least 40 minutes on the rack.</li>
          <li><b>Make the topping.</b> Once the cheesecake is cooled, combine sour cream with sugar until
smooth then spread it over the cheesecake in a thin layer. Place the cheesecake back in a 350
degree oven for 8-10 minutes just until the topping looks set - it will lose its sheen and
appear matte</li>
           <li>Refrigerate for at least 2 hours or overnight. When ready to eat, slice with a hot dry knife and
wipe the knife clean between each slice.</li>
