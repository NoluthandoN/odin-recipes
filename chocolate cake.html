      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>1 3/4 cup(250g) of flour</li>
          <li>2/3 cup of cocoa powder (I prefer Dutch cocoa)</li>
          <p><b>NOTE: if you prefer natural cocoa, my preferences are Ghirardelli 100% Cocoa and
Hershey's Unsweetened</b></p>
           <li>1 teaspoon of baking powder</li>
           <li>1 teaspoon of baking soda</li>
           <li>1 cup (200g) granulated sugar</li>
           <li>1/2 cup (110g) packed light brown sugar</li>
           <li>3/4 teaspoon salt</li>
           <li>2 large eggs</li>
           <li>1/2 cup (120ml) vegetable oil (I prefer sunflower oil)</li>
           <li>3/4 cup (180ml) full fat sour cream</li>
           <li>1 teaspoon (5ml) vanilla extract</li>
           <li>1 cup (240ml) hot coffee</li>
        </ul>
      <h3>Instruction</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Preheat oven to 350°F. Lightly grease two
8-inch round cake pans
, dust lightly with flour andline the base with
rounds of parchment paper.
          </li>
          <li>First prepare the coffee
and keep it hot. If you are using instant coffee, add 1 tablespoon ofinstant coffee granules or 2 teaspoons of
espresso powder
to 1 cup of just boiled water andset it aside while you prepare the batter</li>
         <li>Use a
fine mesh sieve
to sift flour, cocoa powder, baking powder and baking soda into a largebowl. Add both sugars and salt and whisk to blend very well so the ingredients are evenlycombined, pressing out any lumps of brown sugar.</li>
        <li>Combine eggs, oil, sour cream and vanilla in a medium bowl and whisk to blend well. Pourinto the bowl with the dry ingredients and mix with an electric
handheld mixer
on medium-low until blended. You can also mix by hand with a wire whisk. It will be thick and somewhatdry. Add the hot coffee gradually in two stages to minimize clumps forming and mix untilevenly combined and the batter is smooth. The batter will be quite thin.</li>
        <li>Divide batter evenly between the prepared pans and bake for 30-33 minutes until cakesspring back when pressed gently and a skewer inserted into the center comes out clean.Transfer pans to a wire rack and let cool for 15 minutes before running a knife or offsetspatula around the sides and inverting the cakes onto the rack to cool completely.</li>
        <li>While the cakes are cooling, prepare my
BEST Chocolate Fudge Frosting</li>
      <li><b>Assemble the cake.</b>
Once cakes are cooled, place one cake layer on a serving plate. Use a
large offset spatula
to spread about ¾ cup of frosting over the top, spreading it out to theedges. Place the other cake layer on top so it aligns with the sides of the bottom layer. Coverthe entire cake with frosting and use the
offset spatula
to even out the sides and makeswooshes and swirls on the top layer. Enjoy</li>
